        "In today's fast-paced global supply chain, timely and cost-effective logistics play a critical role in the business success. FedEx, as a global logistics service provider , handles a vast number of shipments daily across multiplecountries, vendors and transportation modes.Ensuring that deliveries arrive on time and at optimized costs is essential not only for maintaining customer satisfaction but also for sustaining operational efficiency and profitability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on analysing the FedEx logistics delivery dataset to explore delivery performance trends and uncover patterns that affect shipment delays and freight costs. The datast includes detailed records of shipment information such as shipment modes, managed teams, delivery dates, scheduled delivery dates, countries involved, vendor INCO terms, weights, freight costs, insurance costs and dates when purchase orderd were sent to vendors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key objective of this EDA project is to understand how various features influence delivery outcomes and to identify the factors that contributes to delay or higher costs. By investigating the relationships between variables like shipment mode, country of delivery, vendor terms and delivery lead time, we can extract actionable insights that may help in improving servic reliablity and cost efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis begins with an overview and cleaning of the dataset to identify and handle missing or incorrect data. Next, we create a new feature that helps determine whether a shipment was delivered on time or not. We also compute the number of das between when the purchase order was sent and the scheduled delivery date, as this lead time likely to impact on-time delivery.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core of this project lies in performing univarite, bivariate and multivariate analyses. We explore how the distribution of shipment mode, costs and weights differ across the dataset. Further, we examine how various combinations of features- such as freight cost by shipment mode or delays by country-interact to reveal patterns and insights. Correlation analysis helps us quantify the streangth of relationships between numerical variables, such as weight, freight cost and insurance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using visualisation tools like matplotlib, seaborn and plotly, we present insightd in a clear and intuitive format.These visualizations aid in understanding which factors are most closely associated with delays and high costs. For example, the analysis my reveal that air shipments, although more expensive, have the highest on-time delivery rates, or thet certain countries face more frequent delivery delays due to customs or geographic challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "The findings from this analysis will allow stakeholders at FedEx to make more informed decisions rgarding shipment strategies, vendor negotiations and performance monitoring.Recommendation may inclued optimizing transportation modes, adjusting delivery lead times, or focusing on country specific process improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this project demonstrat hoe data-driven decisions can improve logistics performance and customer satisfaction while reducing unnecessary costs.It serves as a foundational step towards building more predictive and intelligenr logistics systems that adapt to complex supply chain environments.\n"
